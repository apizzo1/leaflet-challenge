## Map Details

This challenge was to create a map of earthquake locations using Leaflet. The maps allow the user to select a specific earthquake and see data (location and magnitude details). Data sources include:
* https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
* https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/blob/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json

### Map Interaction

Leaflet-Step-1 folder holds a basic map that allows the user to select the earthquake points, but does not have any layer functionality.
