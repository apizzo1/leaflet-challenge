## Map Details

This challenge was to create a map of earthquake locations using Leaflet, with tile functionality from Mapbox. Each map shows earthquakes around the world using circular markers, with radius and color indicating the magnitude of the earthquake. The maps allow the user to select a specific earthquake marker and see data (location and magnitude details). Data sources include:
* https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
* https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/blob/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json

### Map Interaction

Leaflet-Step-1 folder holds code to produce a basic map that allows the user to select the earthquake points, but does not have any layer functionality.

Leaflet-Step-2 folder holds code to produce a map with multiple opportunities of user interaction: the user can choose between 3 different base maps (street, satellite, or grayscale) and two different layers (earthquakes or fault lines). Only one base map can be chosen at a time, and one must be chosen at all times. The overlay maps, on the other hand, can be toggled as desired by the user (one displayed at a time, both displayed, or neither displayed). Adding this extra functionality allows the user to investigate the data in a unique way. For example, viewing the earthquakes and fault lines on the same map at the same time allows the user to notice that a high percentage of earthquakes occur in close proximity to fault lines.

Both maps allow the user to zoom in and out as desired, as well as drag the map to a location of interest.

### Files Included

Both folders hold files with the same names:

* index.html will render the map in a browser window - this can be viewed using a live server or by using command python -m http.server in command line
* Static folder containing: 
  * js folder containing logic.js file - this file holds all functionality to bring in geoJSON data, create markers and layers, and render this information on the index.html
  * css folder containing the style.css which formats the map on the index.html and the legend
 
Please note: Mapbox requires an API key to utilize the map tiles - this key was brought in using a config.js file in the js folders of each Leaflet Step folder with format: 

API_KEY = "Your API Key Here";

This file was added to the gitignore so the API key remained private.
