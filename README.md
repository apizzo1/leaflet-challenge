## Map Details

This challenge was to create a map of earthquake locations using Leaflet. Each map shows earthquakes using a circular marker, with radius and color indicating the magnitude of the earthquake. The maps allow the user to select a specific earthquake marker and see data (location and magnitude details). Data sources include:
* https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
* https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/blob/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json

### Map Interaction

Leaflet-Step-1 folder holds code to produce a basic map that allows the user to select the earthquake points, but does not have any layer functionality.

Leaflet-Step-1 folder holds code to produce a map with multiple opportunities of user interaction: the user can choose between 3 different base maps (street, satellite, or grayscale) and two different layers (earthquakes or fault lines).
